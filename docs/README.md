# AR Development Documentation

## How to Build AR Apps Without Overengineering

This documentation captures a complete methodology for building maintainable AR applications using AI assistance while avoiding the common trap of overengineered, unmaintainable code.

## The Problem This Solves

When using AI to generate code:
- Day 1: "Wow, AI is so fast!"
- Day 3: Everything breaks, nobody understands the code
- Day 5: Even AI can't fix its own mess

This framework prevents that collapse.

## Documentation Structure

- **[SUDOLANG_AR_GUIDE.md](SUDOLANG_AR_GUIDE.md)** - Using SudoLang to design before coding
  - How to write blueprints
  - iOS/AR specific patterns
  - Progressive feature development

### üß™ Testing
- **[TESTING_WITHOUT_MOCKS.md](TESTING_WITHOUT_MOCKS.md)** - Real tests without mock theater
  - Why mocks test nothing
  - What to test (calculations)
  - What to skip (iOS frameworks)

### üì± AR Implementation
- **[AR_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](AR_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)** - Building AR apps the simple way
  - Essential iOS/AR concepts
  - Progressive development plan
  - Common features in <100 lines

  - All power prompts
  - Red flags checklist
  - Daily workflow

## How to Use This Documentation

### If You're Starting a New AR Project

1. **Read [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** - Print it, pin it to your wall
2. **Follow [AR_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](AR_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)** - Start with 30 lines
3. **Use [AI_PROMPTING_FRAMEWORK.md](AI_PROMPTING_FRAMEWORK.md)** - Get simple implementations

### If You're Fighting Overengineered Code

1. **Read [DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md](DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md)** - Understand the principles
2. **Check [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** - Look for red flags
3. **Start over with v0.1** - 30 lines that work

### If You Want to Add Features

1. **Use [SUDOLANG_AR_GUIDE.md](SUDOLANG_AR_GUIDE.md)** - Design first
2. **Follow [AI_PROMPTING_FRAMEWORK.md](AI_PROMPTING_FRAMEWORK.md)** - Phase 4
3. **One feature at a time** - Ship weekly

### If You Need to Test

1. **Read [TESTING_WITHOUT_MOCKS.md](TESTING_WITHOUT_MOCKS.md)**
2. **Test calculations only** - Skip iOS frameworks
3. **5 tests maximum** - For entire app

## The Core Methodology

```
LEARN ‚Üí DESIGN ‚Üí BUILD ‚Üí SHIP ‚Üí REPEAT
  ‚Üë                              ‚Üì
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Stay Simple ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

## Key Principles

1. **One Feature Per Week** - Ship every Friday
2. **Under 150 Lines Per File** - No exceptions
3. **No Mocks in Tests** - Test behavior, not mocks
4. **No Custom Systems** - RealityKit already has them
5. **Delete Unclear Code** - If you can't explain it, delete it

## Example: Your First Week

### Monday
```bash
# Read the quick reference
cat docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md

# Learn ARKit basics
"What's the simplest way to show AR camera?"
```

### Tuesday
```sudolang
# Design v0.1
ARApp v0.1 {
  Features { Show AR camera }
  Constraints { Under 50 lines }
}
```

### Wednesday
```bash
# Build
"Convert this SudoLang to Swift. No extras."
```

### Thursday
```bash
# Test manually (no unit tests yet)
# Run on device
```

### Friday
```bash
# Ship to TestFlight
# You have working AR app in 50 lines!
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå Starting with complex architecture
‚úÖ Start with 30 lines

‚ùå Adding multiple features at once
‚úÖ One feature per week

‚ùå Writing elaborate test mocks
‚úÖ Test calculations only

‚ùå Creating Manager/System classes
‚úÖ Direct implementation

‚ùå Keeping code you don't understand
‚úÖ Delete and rewrite simpler

## Success Metrics

You're doing it right if:
- Shipping weekly
- Under 1000 lines after month 1
- Zero "Manager" classes
- Can explain every line
- Adding features is easy

## Remember

> "The best code is the code you understand."

> "Ship 100 working lines, not debug 1000 broken lines."

> "Senior developers write simple code."

## Getting Help

When stuck, ask AI:
1. "How can this be simpler?"
2. "What can I delete?"
3. "Show me Apple's way"

Then check against [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE.md) red flags.
