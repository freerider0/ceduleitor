# Quick Reference: Anti-Overengineering Cheat Sheet

## The Framework in One Page

```
LEARN (ask AI) â†’ DESIGN (SudoLang) â†’ BUILD (AI implements) â†’ SHIP IT
```

## Three Golden Rules
1. **One Feature at a Time** - Never add 2+ features together
2. **Under 150 Lines per File** - Can't fit? You're overengineering
3. **If You Can't Explain It, Delete It** - Every line must make sense

## The Power Prompts

### Research Phase
```
"What's the simplest way to [FEATURE] in iOS?
Show minimal example under 50 lines."
```

### Design Phase (SudoLang)
```sudolang
AppName v0.X {
  Features { [ONE thing] }
  Constraints {
    * Under X lines
    * No systems/managers
  }
}
```

### Implementation Phase
```
"Convert this SudoLang to Swift.
No extras. No managers. Under X lines."
```

### When AI Overengineers
```
"Too complex. Simplify:
- Remove abstractions
- One file if possible
- Direct implementation"
```

## Red Flags = STOP

ðŸš© File over 150 lines â†’ Split or simplify
ðŸš© Words: Manager, System, Factory â†’ Delete
ðŸš© Can't explain it â†’ Delete
ðŸš© AI generates 500+ lines â†’ Start over

## Progressive Development

```
Week 1: v0.1 - Camera only (30 lines)
Week 2: v0.2 - Add detection (60 lines)
Week 3: v0.3 - Add interaction (100 lines)
Week 4: v1.0 - Add measurement (150 lines)
```

## iOS/AR Essential Concepts

### What You Need
- ARSessionDelegate - Get plane events
- UIViewRepresentable - Bridge to SwiftUI
- ObservableObject - Update UI
- Gesture Recognizers - Handle taps

### What You DON'T Need
- Custom Systems - RealityKit has them
- Managers - Direct implementation
- Mocks - Test calculations instead
- Abstractions - Use built-in iOS

## Testing Without Mocks

### Test These
```swift
// Pure functions only
func test_DistanceCalc() {
    XCTAssertEqual(distance(a,b), 5.0)
}
```

### Skip These
```swift
// Don't test iOS frameworks
// Don't mock ARSession
// Don't test delegates
```

## File Structure Target

```
App.swift (20 lines)
ContentView.swift (50 lines)
Coordinator.swift (100 lines)
Models.swift (30 lines)
---
Total: 200 lines
```

## The Daily Workflow

### Morning
```
Ask: "How does [X] work in iOS?"
Learn: Understand the concept
```

### Afternoon
```
Design: 10 lines of SudoLang
Build: AI implements
Test: Does it work?
```

### Evening
```
Ship: Push to TestFlight
Sleep: You understand everything!
```

## Magic Phrases for Simple Code

Use these in every prompt:
- "Minimal viable"
- "Under X lines"
- "No abstractions"
- "Direct implementation"
- "Like Apple's sample code"

## Decision Tree

```
Can you explain it? â†’ No â†’ Delete it
Is it over 150 lines? â†’ Yes â†’ Split it
Does it have "Manager"? â†’ Yes â†’ Remove it
Are there mocks? â†’ Yes â†’ Delete tests
Does it work? â†’ Yes â†’ Ship it!
```

## Complete Example Prompt

```
"Convert this to iOS Swift:

Features:
- Detect AR planes
- Tap to highlight

Requirements:
- Under 100 lines total
- No systems or managers
- Use only RealityKit built-ins
- Direct implementation
- Single file if possible"
```

## Remember

- **Start simple** (30 lines)
- **Add one feature** (ship it)
- **Repeat weekly** (not monthly)
- **Stay under 1000 lines** (first month)
- **Delete "might need it"** code

## The Bottom Line

```
Simple code you understand > Complex code that "might be better"

Ship Friday with 100 working lines
NOT
Debug Monday with 1000 broken lines
```

## Emergency Fixes

### When Lost
```
"Explain what this does and why it's needed"
```

### When Complex
```
"Make this simpler - remove all abstractions"
```

### When Broken
```
Start over with v0.1 - just camera (30 lines)
```
