# PlaneGCS Integration Status

## Current State

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Custom Constraint Solver** - A functional iterative constraint solver (`PlaneGCSSolver.swift`) that handles:
   - Length constraints on edges
   - Horizontal constraints (making edges horizontal)
   - Vertical constraints (making edges vertical)
   - Perpendicular constraints between edges
   - Parallel constraints between edges

2. **UI Integration** - Complete constraint editing interface:
   - Edge selection in edit mode
   - Constraint panel with segmented control for constraint types
   - Numeric input for length constraints
   - Keyboard handling with proper positioning
   - Visual feedback showing which solver is being used

3. **PlaneGCSAdapter** - Prepared adapter class that:
   - Currently uses the custom solver
   - Has commented code ready for real PlaneGCS integration
   - Provides solver information to the UI

### ⚠️ PlaneGCS Package Status
The **actual PlaneGCS package exists** at `/PlaneGCS/` with professional-grade solvers including:
- BFGS optimizer
- Levenberg-Marquardt solver
- DogLeg solver
- Full constraint system implementation

**However, it is NOT currently being used** because:
- The package is not properly linked as a Swift Package dependency in Xcode
- Import statements for PlaneGCS result in "no such module 'PlaneGCS'" error
- The app is using our custom `PlaneGCSSolver.swift` instead

### 🔍 How to Verify Which Solver is Being Used
1. Look at the top of the Floor Plan editor screen - there's a solver info label
2. It currently shows: "Using custom iterative constraint solver (PlaneGCS package not linked)"
3. When you apply constraints, debug logs show "PlaneGCSAdapter: Using custom solver (PlaneGCS package not linked yet)"

## Next Steps to Use Real PlaneGCS

To properly integrate the real PlaneGCS package:

1. **Add as Local Swift Package in Xcode**:
   - Open Xcode project
   - File → Add Package Dependencies
   - Click "Add Local..." button
   - Navigate to `/PlaneGCS/` folder
   - Add to cedularecorder target

2. **Update PlaneGCSAdapter.swift**:
   - Uncomment the `import PlaneGCS` line
   - Uncomment the real implementation code
   - Remove/comment the custom solver fallback

3. **Test the Integration**:
   - Verify constraints still work
   - Check that solver info shows "Using PlaneGCS with DogLeg algorithm"
   - Test all constraint types with the real solver

```

## Summary

The app has a **working constraint system** using a custom solver. The **real PlaneGCS package exists** in the project but needs to be properly linked as a dependency. Once linked, the app is already prepared to switch to the real PlaneGCS implementation through the PlaneGCSAdapter class.
